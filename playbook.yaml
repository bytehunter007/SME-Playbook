# Small Business Playbook

## Introduction
This playbook is designed for a small business with minimal equipment. It covers basic procedures for handling common security incidents.

# 1. Phishing Attack Response
phishing_response:
  - Recognize phishing emails by checking for:
    - Suspicious sender addresses.
    - Urgent or strange requests (e.g., "click here to update your account").
    - Misspellings and grammatical errors.
  - If a phishing email is suspected:
    - Do not click any links or download attachments.
    - Forward the email to IT or the designated security contact.
    - Mark the email as spam/phishing.
  - If a user clicks on a phishing link:
    - Disconnect the machine from the internet.
    - Reset passwords for any accounts potentially compromised.
    - Notify IT immediately.

# 2. Endpoint Security
endpoint_security:
  - Ensure all devices are:
    - Running up-to-date antivirus software.
    - Locked with strong passwords.
    - Configured to auto-lock after 5 minutes of inactivity.
  - Regularly scan devices for malware using built-in or third-party antivirus tools.
  - Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all accounts where possible.

# 3. Patch Management
patch_management:
  - Keep all software up-to-date by:
    - Enabling automatic updates for operating systems and applications.
    - Regularly checking for and applying manual updates for devices that don't update automatically.
  - Create a schedule to review software updates every month.
